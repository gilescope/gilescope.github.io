Working with Andy at a startup. Big industrial building, people coming in from all angles. Where do I put the key back? I put it in what looks like a lawnmower with rotating lid window that one can put a key down into or pick others up out of.

Walking with Alys, viewing icescapes. The ice is melting so we have to be careful now, Some crystals growing left right heading together and closing up a gap.

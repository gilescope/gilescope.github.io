You lock your back door when you go out right? It's important not to leave yourself wide open to criminals - Get yourself tested at <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html" target="_blank">SslLabs.com.</a>

Make a static version of your website so you can publish with S3:
(For mac brew install wget)
wget -m -k -r --adjust-extension --restrict-file-names=windows

I love the idea of PublishPress also but that seems to require a multi-site wp install.

Everyone needs inspiration, and while there's many sites out there https://www.crayon.co/ is unique in showing you how a site or landing page has changed over time. What better way to see the visual impact of what they've changed? A great way to learn a lot.
